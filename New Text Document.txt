Events
1. Ritambhara
This is the most watched event of Antaragni. It is a team event in which your team must fight tooth and nail against other teams in a battle of fashion. Fashionistas from around the country judge the teams; satiate them and you may be the next Mr. or Miss Ritambhara!!

2. VelvetLock
In 2012, VelvetLock was just born. But over the years, the support of our sponsors, judges, and not-to-forget audiences and particpants, has transformed the neonate into a fatal attraction. A competition on the lines of Mr and Miss India contests, VelvetLock is one classy event that you'd be a fool to miss!!
